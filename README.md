## Description
I learned python at first for data analysis, but even after a lot of analysis work I didn't have a great applied understanding of the classes and management of the flow of code in python, so I used this project as a chance to apply my knowledge of classes and to sharpen my skills.This project is designed to be a knitting pattern editor to make an easier platform for knitters to share and make patterns for their clothes. This is a project I am currently working on so I am not uploading my final full feature version, but on here is a minimum viable product of a feature in the app. 

## How to Run Project
- Download zip file of project files
- Place files in Python IDE (or use terminal)
- Install Imported Pakages (for me when I tried a fresh installation the only one I needed to install was Pillow (this corresponds with the "import PIL" statement))
- IMPORTANT, If on a mac everything should run fine, as the tkinter library has errors on mac and I had to import a library called tkmacosx to fix them. But, if you are on a windows device, a fix to make the code run is to comment out the "import tkmacosx" with a (#) and then underneath type "import tk as tkmacosx" to link the calls to tkmacosx back to the original tk library.
- run the file "KnittingAppRun.py"

<sub> Note: If you have the option to run it on mac, I suggest do that because I designed it on mac, therefore UI will look more appealing on it as well. </sub>
